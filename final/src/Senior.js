            Home care makes aging in place possible for millions of seniors
            every year. Instead of moving to an assisted living facility or a
            nursing home, seniors can continue living where they feel happiest
            and most comfortable — their home. No one understands the importance
            of senior care like we do at Visiting Angels®. As one of the
            country's most trusted home care agencies in the country, we make
            senior care possible for older adults across the U.S. Our in-home
            care services for the elderly make daily living safer and more
            enjoyable, allowing seniors to spend their golden years in the
            comfort of home.
